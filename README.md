# An Insulator Missing Defect Detection Method Based on Aerial Images by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle in High-Voltage Transmission Lines



## Abstract

Insulators are an essential electrical component in high-voltage transmission lines. Insulators need to be regularly inspected for defects to maintain stable power transmission. The traditional manual inspection is inefficient. So, a more intelligent and efficient inspection solution is urgently needed. In this paper, the proposed insulator missing defect detection method combine unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography and deep learning to solve this problem.
